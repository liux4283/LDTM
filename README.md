## Installation

You can install the development version of LDTM from
[GitHub](https://github.com/Goodgolden/LDTM) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Goodgolden/LDTM")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(LDTM)
#> Loading required package: tidyverse
#> ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──
#> ✓ ggplot2 3.3.5     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
#> ✓ tibble  3.1.6     ✓ dplyr   1.0.8
#> ✓ tidyr   1.2.0     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
#> ✓ readr   2.1.2     ✓ forcats 0.5.1
#> ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
#> x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
#> x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
